# UserAuthenticationAuthorizationManagement
I am a new bee to Spring Security, Oauth2. I am building a User Management system, that could handle UAA using Oauth2. Given the availability of plethora of technilogies, framewors, tutorials it is still possibile to get lost in the ocean. Thus, I create this repository to document my learning curve to help those new bees who want to know what they are building.

# Technical stack
  - Gradle 3.4.1
  - Java 1.8
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring security
  - Spring Oauth2
  - Angular JS

### Disclaimer
This repository is created with an expectation of documenting and possibility provide a detailed, hands-on tutorial on building a UAAM.
Expect changes in concepts, design and etc.
